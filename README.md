                                            # Health_Prediction_Web_Application
A machine learning-based web application that provides predictive insights into various health parameters such as Calories Burned, Health Risk Level, Activity Type, and Body Temperature based on user inputs. This app is designed to promote personal health awareness using data-driven models.

Features:


Calories Burned Prediction: Estimates calories burned based on user inputs like age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, and duration of activity.

Health Risk Level Prediction: Classifies users into Low, Medium, or High health risk categories based on clinical and physical attributes.

Activity Recognition: Identifies the type of physical activity (e.g., Walking, Jogging, Running) based on physiological data.

Body Temperature Prediction: Predicts body temperature using features such as heart rate, activity duration, and other personal metrics.
